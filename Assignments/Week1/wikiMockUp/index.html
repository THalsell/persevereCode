        This is the front page of the Simple English Wikipedia. Wikipedias are places where people work together to write encyclopedias in different languages. We use Simple English words and grammar here. The Simple English Wikipedia is for everyone, such as children and adults who are learning English. There are 243,705 articles on the Simple English Wikipedia. All of the pages are free to use. They have all been published under both the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GNU Free Documentation License. You can help here! You may change these pages and make new pages. Read the help pages and other good pages to learn how to write pages here. If you need help, you may ask questions at Simple talk. <br> When writing articles here:

        Use Basic English words and shorter sentences. This allows people to understand complex terms or phrases.
        Write good pages. The best encyclopedia pages have useful, well-written information.
        Use the pages to learn and teach. These pages can help people learn English. You can also use them to make a new Wikipedia to help other people.
        Simple does not mean short. Writing in Simple English means that simple words are used. It does not mean readers want basic information. Articles do not have to be short to be simple; expand articles, add details, but use basic vocabulary.
        Be bold! Your article does not have to be perfect, because other editors will fix it and make it better. And most importantly, do not be afraid to start and make articles better yourself.</div>

        Gothic cathedrals are important examples of gothic architecture. Gothic architecture began in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Gothic architecture started in the 12th century, and lasted until the 16th century. Important features of the style are pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses.
        
        Today, people associate the style mainly with cathedrals, churches, and abbeys, but it was also used for castles, palaces, universities, and some houses.
        
        Today, many buildings still remain in that style. Smaller ones are thought to be very beautiful, bigger ones are often seen as priceless works of art.
        
        In the 19th century, the Gothic style became popular again, particularly for building churches and universities. This style is called Gothic Revival architecture.</div>
